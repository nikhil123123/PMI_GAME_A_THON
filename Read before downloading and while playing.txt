** PLEASE READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING AND OPENING THE GAME. ALSO READ IT WHILE PLAYING THE GAME FOR EASYNESS **


1. To download this game, the user needs to first exclude the folder to windows defender.
Go to Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Virus & threat protection. Under Virus & threat protection settings, select Manage settings, and then under Exclusions, select Add or remove exclusions. Select Add an exclusion, and then select from files, folders, file types, or process. Otherwise your pc will make it isolate from the rest of files, treating the game as anonymous.
* The game does not contain virus this is due to we couldnt afford digital signature which is costly. *

2. After following the above method. Open the folder (do match all the files to be sure so that none of them is deleted by the windows defender).


3. This game is just a prototype of the major game. We've added only 3 levels in it and each level have 3 to 4 answers.

Level 1:
	answer1 = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
	answer2 = 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
	answer3 = 1 7 13 19 2 8 14 20 3 9 15 21 4 10 16 22 5 11 17 23 6 12 18 24
	answer4 = 1 2 3 4 24 23 22 21 5 6 7 8 20 19 18 17 9 10 11 12 16 14 15 13
*note*- one space should be given between each number.ENTER to submit the answer and then u will get the result.
Like this many series can be formed but for now our prototype is limited to these answers as we have added only these in the program. 

Level 2
	answer1 = '1 2 3 4 5 21 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 6 22 23 24'
	answer2 = '1 2 3 4 5 11 7 8 9 10 6 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24'
	answer3 = '1 2 3 4 5 15 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 6 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24'
	answer4 = '1 2 3 4 5 24 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 6' 
*note*- one space should be given between each number.ENTER to submit the answer and then u will get the result.

Level 3

	answer2 = '1 2 3 4 5 20 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 6 21 22 23 24'

The game resolution is fixed, you don't need to worry about the screen not going to maximize mode
No music down button is given, use your system volume button to reduce the volume

* TO SEE THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE LEVEL FAST WITHOUT ANSWER U CAN USE:   
Level 1 - a
Level 2 - m
Level 3 - z
This is there for developers use, but can be used as a cheat code too (IN PROTOTYPE ONLY)

** HOPE U ENJOY **
